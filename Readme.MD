## Synopsis

NOTE: This will not run on your computer without Anchor Software!

The goal of this script was to learn how to write Powershell.
The function of this script is to automatically produce scripts in the language of Anchor, for the purpose of re-mapping fields in data files via byte level manipulation.

## Motivation

This project started as a proof of concept to my boss that we could automate the tasks that eat up a good 50% of our day.
Ultimately, it was a success and worked for the majority of our oddball jobs that come from infrequent clients.
This script was not kept up to date, because we used the time savings to re-write the rest of our codebase.

## To the Reader

Take this code as an example of rushed, beginner level code knowledge. This is the absolute worst my code has ever looked, but it represents my first major accomplishment for my employer.
This paved the way to huge changes at the company which are the driving force behind my career right now.
